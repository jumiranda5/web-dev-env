# Webpack starter for static pages

Webpack 5 basic configuration to use with static websites, built while following The Odin Project [chapter on Webpack](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-webpack).

I went through these documentation pages to build it:

- [Output Management](https://webpack.js.org/guides/output-management/)
- [Development](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/)
- [Production](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/)
- [Entry Points](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/#multi-page-application)
- [Image Minimizer Plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/image-minimizer-webpack-plugin/#root)
